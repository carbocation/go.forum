/*
Entry is the fundamental unit of a threaded discussion. An entry can represent
a forum, a post, or a comment, depending on how it is annotated. There is nothing
fundamentally distinct about these things, and their similarities (including
hierarchical nesting) are abundant.

For entry methods that manipulate the database in some way, see entry_db.go
